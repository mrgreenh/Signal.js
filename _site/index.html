      <h2>A signal-based approach to javascript animations:</h2>
      <div id="signal-ui-container">

      </div>
  </section>

  <div class="content-body">
    <section>
      <p>Signal.js is a little javascript utility meant to make it easy and fun to process streams of numbers with something similar to an effects rack. It really is just a 'thing' that takes numbers in one side and spits other numbers out from the other side. And I understand that might sound very generic, in fact it is. The reason why this came into being is another project I am working on, where I need to turn MIDI notes into some kind of a visual representation.</p>

      <p>Now this is what a MIDI note looks like:
      <img src="/Signal.js/squarewave.png" alt="Square wave" />
      Now imagine applying that to, say, the size of a circle on screen. The circle would just blink in and out of the page. Boring, right?
      So you make it go through a low-pass filter and you get something less flashy and more natural, like:
      <img src="/Signal.js/lowpass.png" alt="Square wave after lowpass" />
      But then say your musical note needs to represent a wobbly noisy sound. Then you might want to blend in some white noise, maybe offset this stream of numbers and amplify it a bit. And then say you want to add a delay... The list goes on. What I needed was some library that quickly lets me define filters and effects similar to the ones I would find in a sound effects rack. And that in the same way lets me pipe them one after the other. So that's what Signal.js is.</p>

      <p>Turns out you can use this for javascript animations in a broader sense, for anything related to user interactions that produce streams of numbers, for example scrolling or accelerometer data. But I might write about some better examples of that sort later.</p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <p>How about a:</p>
      <pre>
npm install signaljs --save
      </pre>

      <p>And then something to make sure all went well:</p>

      <pre><code>
import Signal from 'signaljs'
//Get a list of available modules
var modulesNamesList = Signal.getModulesList();
      </code></pre>

      <p>That gets the configuration schemas for the available modules. This will contain some default values that you can use as configuration for a module instance. It will also contain extra information that can turn out useful if you want to build some visual configuration tool. Like the one I built on top of this page. But that I am too lazy right now to generalize it and make it useful :) But if you need something like that just ask and I'll feel motivated enough to do it!</p>

      <p>
      Now you can do one of two things:
      <ul>
        <li>Create a configuration, which is basically an array of configuration objects, and pass that to Signal, which will build the pipeline for you,</li>
        <li>Manually import and initialize modules, and .chain() them... This might be useful if you want to do some more complicated stuff.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <pre><code>
import Signal from 'signaljs'

var thresholdConfig = Signal.getConfigurationSchemaForModule("Threshold");
thresholdConfig.threshold.value = 5;

var lowPassConfig = Signal.getConfigurationSchemaForModule("LowPass");

var signal = new Signal([lowPassConfig, thresholdConfig]);

var outputSignal = [];
var inputSignal = [1,2,3,4,5,100,7,8,9];

for(let val of inputSignal){ //Don't try this at home
    outputSignal.push(signal.push(val));
}

console.log(outputSignal);
//[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19.166666666666668, 17.428571428571427, 16.25, 15.444444444444445]
</code></pre>

<p>OR you can do this too:</p>

<pre><code>
import Signal from 'signaljs'

var Threshold = Signal.getModule("Threshold");
var thresholdConfig = Signal.getConfigurationSchemaForModule("Threshold");
thresholdConfig.threshold.value = 5;

var LowPass = Signal.getModule("LowPass");
var lowPassConfig = Signal.getConfigurationSchemaForModule("LowPass");

var lowPass = new LowPass(lowPassConfig);
var threshold = new Threshold(thresholdConfig);
lowPass.chain(threshold);

var outputSignal = [];
var inputSignal = [1,2,3,4,5,100,7,8,9];

for(let val of inputSignal){
    outputSignal.push(lowPass.queueSample(val));
}

console.log(outputSignal);
//[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19.166666666666668, 17.428571428571427, 16.25, 15.444444444444445]
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Writing a new module</h2>
      <p>This is an example on how you define a module, and this one is literally the most complicated there is at the time of writing:</p>
      <pre><code>
import SignalModule from '../SignalModule'

class LowPass extends SignalModule {

    constructor(configuration){
        /*SignalModule always gets initialized with a buffer, basically just a linked list of values of fixed length-
        When something gets pushed into a buffer that has reached its size limit, the oldest value is dropped.*/
        super(configuration.bufferSize.value);
        //Nothing else to add in this constructor but other modules might have more to say.
    }

    _processOutput(){
        //Computes the output. Yeah because you also need that.
        var sum = 0;
        for(let value of this._buffer.iterate()){
            sum += value;
        }
        return sum ? sum/this._buffer.length : 0;
    }

    static getConfigurationSchema(){
        /*Useful when you want to build a little editor with sliders
        that lets you modify your effects rack.
        You would use this metadata to build the UI.*/
        var conf = super.getConfigurationSchema();
        return Object.assign(conf, {
            type: LowPass.MODULE_NAME,
            bufferSize: {
                display: "Buffer Size",
                type: "number",
                range: [2,100],
                value: 100
            }
        });
    }
}

LowPass.MODULE_NAME = "LowPass";

export default LowPass;
      </code></pre>

      <p>And add it to the modules bag ModulesBag.js. Or forget to do it and bang your head on the keyboard until you remember about it. Such great design.</p>

      <p>Now go build bautiful things! Or ugly ones! Just.... go, nothing left to read here. Except the license, which basically means do whatever you want:</p>
