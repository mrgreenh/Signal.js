      <p>Signal.js is a little javascript utility meant to make it easy and fun to process streams of numbers with something similar to an effects rack. It really is just a 'thing' that takes numbers in one side and spits other numbers out from the other side. And I understand that might sound very generic, in fact it is. The reason why this came into being is another project I am working on, where I need to turn MIDI notes into some kind of a visual representation.</p>

      <p>Now this is what a MIDI note looks like:
      <img src="/Signal.js/squarewave.png" alt="Square wave" />
      Now imagine applying that to, say, the size of a circle on screen. The circle would just blink in and out of the page. Boring, right?
      So you make it go through a low-pass filter and you get something less flashy and more natural, like:
      <img src="/Signal.js/lowpass.png" alt="Square wave after lowpass" />
      But then say your musical note needs to represent a wobbly noisy sound. Then you might want to blend in some white noise, maybe offset this stream of numbers and amplify it a bit. And then say you want to add a delay... The list goes on. What I needed was some library that quickly lets me define filters and effects similar to the ones I would find in a sound effects rack. And that in the same way lets me pipe them one after the other. So that's what Signal.js is.</p>

      <p>Turns out you can use this for javascript animations in a broader sense, for anything related to user interactions that produce streams of numbers, for example scrolling or accelerometer data. But I might write an article with some better examples of that sort later. Maybe one of those Medium posts because it's so "in" now to write Medium posts =)</p>

      <h2>Writing a new module</h2>
      <p>This is an example on how you define a module, and this one is literally the most complicated there is at the time of writing:</p>
      <pre><code>
import SignalModule from '../SignalModule'

class LowPass extends SignalModule {

    constructor(configuration){
        super(configuration.bufferSize.value);
        //Nothing else to add for now but other modules might have more to say
    }

    _processOutput(){
        //One new value was just pushed into the buffer. The output on the other side is...
        var sum = 0;
        for(let value of this._buffer.iterate()){
            sum += value;
        }
        return sum ? sum/this._buffer.length : 0;
    }

    static getConfigurationSchema(){
        /*Useful when you want to build a little editor with sliders
        that lets you modify your effects rack.
        You would use this metadata to build the UI.*/
        var conf = super.getConfigurationSchema();
        return Object.assign(conf, {
            type: LowPass.MODULE_NAME,
            bufferSize: {
                display: "Buffer Size",
                type: "number",
                range: [2,100],
                value: 100
            }
        });
    }
}

LowPass.MODULE_NAME = "LowPass";

export default LowPass;
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <pre><code>
import Signal from 'path/to/signal'
//Get a list of available modules
var modulesNamesList = Signal.getModulesList();
      </code></pre>

      Get the configuration schema for some module. This will contain some default values that you can use as configuration for a module instance. It will also contain extra information that can turn out useful if you want to build some visual configuration tool.

      <pre><code>
//Default configuration for first one of the available modules
var newModuleConfiguration = Signal.getConfigurationSchemaForModule(modulesNamesList[0]);
      </code></pre>

      Now you can do one of two things:
      - Create a configuration, which is basically an array of configurations objects, and pass that to Signal, which will build the pipeline for you
      - Manually import and initialize modules, and .chain() them.

      <pre><code>
var processingPipeline = new Signal([
                                        newModuleConfiguration,
                                        otherNewModuleConfiguration
                                    ]);

//OR

var LowPass = Signal.getModule(moduleNamesList[0]);
var WhiteNoise = Signal.getModule("WhiteNoise");
var whiteNoiseConfig = Signal.gerConfigurationSchemaForModule("WhiteNoise");
var processingPipeline = new LowPass(newModuleConfiguration)
                                    .chain(new WhiteNoise(whiteNoiseConfig));
      </code></pre>

      Finally, start using your pipeline by pushing value. Each .push(newValue) will return the result of such value going through all filters in your pipeline.


      <pre><code>
var outputSignal = [];
var inputSignal = [];

for(let val of inputSignal){ //Don't try this at home
    outputSignal.push(processingPipeline.push(val));
}
      </code></pre>
